# Deep_Learning_AI
AndrewNg's Coursera class
Task 1:
  build a L-layer Neural Network for binary classification problem (0-1)
  Dataset: bank-note folder (from UC-Irvine)

Task 2:
build a L-layer Neural Network with L2-normalization
Same dataset from task 1 is used in this file, except that only 2 features are used for visualization purpose. L2 norm is controlled by the parameter lambd.
Three different lambds are testes, namely [0, 0.01, 0.5]
The plots (4 figures) indicate their loss values with first 5000 iterations (pic 1); their prediction regions (pic2-pic4)
