Task 1: \n
  build a L-layer Neural Network for binary classification problem (0-1)\n
  Dataset: bank-note folder (from UC-Irvine)\n
\n
Task 2:\n
build a L-layer Neural Network with L2-normalization \n
Same dataset from task 1 is used in this file, except that only 2 features are used for visualization purpose. L2 norm is controlled by the parameter lambd.\n
Three different lambds are testes, namely [0, 0.01, 0.5]\n
The plots (4 figures) indicate their loss values with first 5000 iterations (pic 1); their prediction regions (pic2-pic4) \n
The result indicates that prediction accuracy on test set is higher if using L2-normalization.
